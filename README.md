Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset | PostgreSQL

In this project, order, customer, seller, and payment analyses were conducted using the Brazilian e-commerce public dataset provided by Olist. Additionally, RFM analysis was applied for customer segmentation.

About the Dataset The dataset contains information from approximately 100,000 orders made on various marketplaces in Brazil between the years 2016-2018. It provides data across various dimensions, such as order status, pricing, payment and delivery performance, customer location, product features, and customer reviews.

The dataset consists of the following main files:

customers.csv: Customer and location information.

geolocation.csv: Brazilian postal codes and geographical coordinates.

order_items.csv: Product details within orders.

order_payments.csv: Payment information for the orders.

order_reviews.csv: Customer reviews.

orders.csv: General information about the orders.

products.csv: Product details.

sellers.csv: Seller information.

product_category_name_translation.csv: English translations of product category names.

Analyses The following analyses were conducted as part of the project:

Order Analysis

Monthly Order Distribution: The monthly distribution of orders was examined.
Order Statuses: The changes in different order statuses over time were analyzed.
Orders by Product Categories: The popular categories were identified.
Orders by Days of the Week: An analysis was done on which days orders were concentrated.

Customer Analysis

Customer Distribution by Cities: The cities with the most orders were determined.

Seller Analysis

Fastest Delivering Sellers: The fastest sellers and their number of orders along with customer reviews were analyzed.
Sellers with Product Variety: Sellers offering the most different product categories and their order counts were examined.

Payment Analysis

Installment Count by Regional Distribution: Regions with the most customers using installment payments were identified.
Order and Amount Analysis by Payment Type: An analysis of the number of orders and total amounts for different payment methods was carried out.
Distribution of One-Time and Installment Payments by Category: It was examined which categories saw more installment payments.

RFM Analysis

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was applied for customer segmentation. Through this analysis, customers were divided into segments based on their shopping frequency, date of last purchase, and total spending. This way, it became possible to develop marketing strategies for different customer groups.

Conclusion 

This project aims to help businesses better understand customer behaviors and make strategic decisions by deeply analyzing Brazilian e-commerce data. The findings provide valuable insights for improving marketing, sales, and logistics processes.
